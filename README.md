# Rouvik's Home Server
## What is this?
This is a simple home server written in some hacky node.js and express for my own personal home server

## Why?
Well it's mostly passion (and seriously most of it's features can be acheived quite easily)
and also I wanted a better and more intuitive to the eye file system crawler, online shell for my system
instead of requiring me to ssh into it and use scp to copy stuff from the server

## Features:
- Fully fledged file server serving files all across the system
- Over the internet shell to access and take control of the system at ease without ssh stuff

## Planned features:
- A complete web based process manager (most likely next feature)
- A better FTP alternative solution over the https to make sharing files (especially folders) much easier
    - This is kinda already partially implemented with the file server but it doesnt support folders I am looking forward to instead add this feature to it
- Github like blob viewer for my bare git repositories in the server
